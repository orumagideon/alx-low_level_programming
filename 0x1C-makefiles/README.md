The project involves creating Makefiles and testing them. It includes a series of Makefiles (0-Makefile, 1-Makefile, 2-Makefile, 3-Makefile, 4-Makefile, and 100-Makefile) with various features, building on each other. These Makefiles are used to compile C code in school.c and main.c, producing an executable called "school." The tasks include defining rules for building, cleaning, and recompiling, and setting compiler flags. Additionally, there's a Python script (5-island_perimeter.py) that calculates the perimeter of an island in a grid. The final Makefile (100-Makefile) ensures proper functionality while adhering to specific requirements, such as the presence of a header file (m.h).
