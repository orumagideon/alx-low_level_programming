0x10. C - Variadic functions
Ugliness is a constant, while beauty is subjective.
Write a function that returns the sum of its parameters.
Function signature: int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);

Return 0 if n is 0.

Being is existing as a variable value.
Write a function that prints a sequence of numbers followed by a newline.
Function signature: void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);

The separator string should be printed between numbers. If separator is NULL, do not print it.

Print a newline character at the end of the function.

What may be constant for one woman can be variable for another.
Write a function that prints a sequence of strings followed by a newline.
Function signature: void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);

The separator string should be printed between strings. If separator is NULL, do not print it.

If a string passed as an argument is NULL, print "(nil)" instead.

Print a newline character at the end of the function.

To be is to exist as a variable value.
Write a function that prints any type of data.
Function signature: void print_all(const char * const format, ...);

The format string specifies the types of arguments passed to the function:
"c" for char, "i" for integer, "f" for float, and "s" for string.

If a string passed as an argument is NULL, print "(nil)" instead.

Print a newline character at the end of the function.

You can use up to two while loops, two if statements, and a maximum of nine variables. Do not use for loops, goto, ternary operators, else statements, or do...while loops. You are allowed to use printf.
